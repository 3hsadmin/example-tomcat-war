<username>/SimpleTomcatWebApp:
  Env:
    # Use environment variables to specify the path to your tomcat
    # installation. This is where the webapps will be copied
    - CATALINA_HOME: "/var/lib/tomcat7"

    # If the name of the war file is not known ahead of time (maybe
    # created dynamically by jenkins) you can specify the environment
    # variable here and we can use this to copy the file to a well
    # known name
    #- WAR_NAME: '$JENKINS_ID.war'

  PreRelease:
    # If we need to rename the war file from a name containing GUIDs
    # to a well known name we can do it here before we package it
    # up. Uncomment this if the WAR_NAME variable above is uncommented
    #- 'sudo cp -f $WARNAME SimpleTomcatWebApp.war'

  PkgInclude:
    - '/target/SimpleTomcatWebApp.war'

  PostInstall:
    # Copy the all the WAR files packaged to tomcat webapps dir.
    - 'sudo cp -f ./target/*.war $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/'

    # By default tomcat detects if the war file has changed and
    # automatically extracts it. If restart is required you can
    # restart tomcat with the command below.

    # Restart Tomcat - You might have to use a different command
    # depending on how tomcat is installed
    #- 'sudo service tomcat7 restart'
